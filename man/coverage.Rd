\usage{

coverage(x, ...)

\method{coverage}{default}(x, y, alternative = c("less", "greater"),...)

\method{coverage}{QCA}(x, data, type = c("raw", "unique"), which = 1, ...)

consistency(x,...)

\method{consistency}{default}(x, y, alternative = c("less", "greater"), ...)

}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a numeric vector of fuzzy set score for default method of
    coverage and consistency. A QCA object for QCA method of coverage.
}
\item{y}{
  a numeric vector of fuzzy set score.
}
  \item{alternative}{
    specify the relationship between x and y.
  }
  \item{data}{The original data which are used to generate the QCA object.}
  \item{which}{length-1 positive integer to select a solution from the QCA object.}
  \item{type}{The type of coverage.}
  \item{\ldots}{not used currently.}
}
\details{
  Given two fuzzy set score variables x and y, coverage returns the coverage
  of x by y, given their relationship; and consistency returns  the
  consistency of x by y.

  When alternative is "less", it returns coverage(x<=y). This is
  coverage for sufficent test. When "greater", it returns
  coverage(x>=y), it is coverage for necessary condition.

  This value can be used to evaluate the importance or relevance of x as
  a necessary condition for Y. When coverage(x>=y) is small, the
  constraining effect of x on y is negligible. In other words, small
  value of coverage(x>=y) indicates en empirically trivial necessary
  condition (Ragin, 2008: 61).
}
\value{
  For default method of coverage and consistency, the value is a
  length-1 numeric vector.
