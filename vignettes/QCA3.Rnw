\section{Introduction}
QCA3 can do various types of qualitative comparative analysis, namely
crisp set QCA, fuzzy set QCA and multi-value QCA.
It allows inclusion of simplifying assumptions and can produce
intermediate solutions.

All examples in \cite{RihouxRagin2009} can be reproduced by QCA3
package. To reproduce the following examples, you need to load the
QCA3 package first by
<<>>=
library(QCA3)
@

\section{Crisp set QCA}

Before conducting crisp set QCA (csQCA) with QCA3, you need to import your dataset into R. If
your data is in Excel format, I would recommend you to export the data
to a csv file and import the csv file into R by read.csv function. In
this article, all datasets are shipped with the QCA3 package, thus I
will skip the steps of data import.

In crisp set QCA (csQCA), all variables are binary (0 or
1). The dataset in this example is Lipset_cs. The first step is to
construct a truth table. You can use the function of
cs_truthTable to do it.

<<>>=
(cst <- cs_truthTable(Lipset_cs,outcome="SURVIVAL",
                      condition=c("GNPCAP", "URBANIZA", "LITERACY", "INDLAB", "GOVSTAB"),
                      cases="CASEID"))
@

The above command constructs a truth table and assigns it to an object
called cst, which can be used in the following analyses. You can
choose any legitimate object name to store the produced truth table as long as it is a
legitimate name in R.

In this command, Lipset_cs is the data frame which contains all the variables. The
argument of outcome specificifies the explained variable, say "SURVIVAL"
in this example (note that you need to enclose SURVIVAL with
quotation mark). The argument of condition specificies the explanatory
variables. It is a string vector, each element of which is a
condition or explanatory variable. At least two conditions are needed. In this example, five
conditions are provided. All variables, be outcome or conditions, are
in the data frame of Lipset_cs. For more details, you can refer to the
help page of cs_truthTable.

The truth table is constructed by cs_truthTable in an automatic manner.
However, you can also manually override the outcome by function of
setOUT, but I will not go through the details here.

At this moment, you need to examine the truth table closely. Perhaps,
it is a good idea to make connections between the truth table and the
detailed empirical evidence about each case. Special attention should
be paid to contradictory configurations, and you  need to to handle
such contradictory configurations if any. Once you have a truth table without
contradictory configuration or you have come up a strategy to handle
them, you can move to the next step, minimization of the truth table
without remainders. All you need to d is to pass the truth table, cst,
produced previously, to the reduce function.
<<>>=
reduce(cst)
@

The default explains positive outcome (in this case,
SURVIVAL=1). If you want to explain negative outcome, you need to set
the argument of explain to "negative", which is the third step.

<<>>=
reduce(cst, explain="negative")
@

By default, remainders are not used and no simplifying assumption is
made. The fourth step is to get the most parsimonious solution to
positive outcome by including remainders. All you need to do is to
set the argument of remainders to "include".

<<>>=
reduce(cst, remainders="include")
@

Similarly, you can explain negative outcome by including
remainders. Now, you need to specify both arguments of explain and remainders.

<<>>=
reduce(cst, explain="negative", remainders="include")
@

Now, you may wonder what remainders have been included. It is always a
good idea to examine them. To do so, you need to assign the return of
reduce to an object first. Take the explanation of negative outcome
for example. Let assign it to an object called ansNeg. Then you can
pass ansNeg to the function of SA, which will return a list of
remainders used in the minimization (which are also called simplifying
assuptions). It shows that 18 remainders have been included.

<<>>=
ansNeg <- reduce(cst, explain="negative", remainders="include")
SA(ansNeg)

\section{fuzzy set QCA}
\subsection{Calibration}
Fuzzy set QCA (fsQCA) requires fuzzy set scores, which range from 0 to
1. The fuzzy membership scores can be directly assigned according to
substantive knowledge about the cases at hand.

Often, researchers have interval measures and need to convert such
measures into fuzzy membership scores. This process is called
caliberation, which is described in \cite{Ragin2008}. The QCA3 package
implements the direct method of caliberation. This method requires
researchers to choose three anchors, namely fullin, fullout and
crossover values. The fullin value is recoded as fuzzy set score of
0.953. The fullout value is recoded as fuzzy set score of 0.03, and
the crossover value is recoded as fuzzy set score of 0.5
\footnote{0.953 and 0.03 are chosen because the log odds of them are 3
  and -3 respectively, which are approximate to the description in
  \cite{Ragin2008}. However, users should note that the result is
  slightly different from fs/QCA because exact log odds of the fullin and
  fullout fuzzy membership scores rather than 3 and -3 are used in the
  QCA3 package.}. Researchers must choose the three anchors based on
substantive knowledge. One you have the fullin, fullout and corssover
values, you can caliberate the fuzzy set scores by the
directCaliberate function.

For example, the data frame of Lipset_fs has an interval variable of
Developed, and the following command caliberate it with three anchors of
900 (fullin), 400 (fullout), and 500 (crossover).
<<>>=
directCalibration(Lipset_fs$Developed,fullin=900,fullout=400, crossover=550)
@

You can also add the returned fuzzy set score to the data frame (Lipset_fs) as a
variable (DFZ) by,

<<eval=FALSE>>=
Lipset_fs$DFZ <- directCalibration(Lipset_fs$Developed,900,400, 550)
@

\subsection{Exploratory Analysis}
Before jumping into fuzzy set QCA, it is always a good idea to explore the
bivariate relationship between outcome and condition variables. The
key measures are sufficiency scores and necessary scores. The suffnec
function takes a data frame as input and produces both sufficiency
scores and necessary scores matrices.

<<>>=
suffnec(Lipset_fs[,c("Survived.FZ","Developed.FZ","Urban.FZ",
                     "Literate.FZ","Industrial.FZ", "Stable.FZ")])
@

In the above command, Lipset_fs is the name of a data frame. Here I use
the "[" operator to extract a relevant subset, which is then passed to suffnec.

You can use a graph to depict the set-theoretic consistency and
coverage. The function fsplot provides a friendly interface. For
example, if you want to examine whether development and
urbanization are sufficient for regime survival, you can use the following command.

<<fig=TRUE>>=
fsplot(Survived.FZ~fsand(Developed.FZ, Urban.FZ),data=Lipset_fs)
@

The fsplot use a formula interface. The left hand side variable is the
outcome variable. The right hand side is explanatory
variable. When the explanatory variable is a conjunctural condition,
you can use fsand to get the conjunctural condition before
plotting. In the above example, the right hand side is
fsand(Developed.FZ, Urban.FZ), which suggests that
Developed.FZ*Urban.FZ is regarded as a conjunctural condition.

The consistency and coverage scores are displayed in the figure, which
eases the interpretation of the result.

\subsection{Fuzzy set truth table and minimization}
At this point, we have made up our minds concerning the
conditions, and we can construct a fuzzy set truth table for further
analysis. In the textbook example, five conditions are chosen, and the
consistency threshold is set to 0.7.

<<>>=
conditions <- c("Developed.FZ","Urban.FZ","Literate.FZ","Industrial.FZ", "Stable.FZ")
fst <- fs_truthTable(Lipset_fs,"Survived.FZ", conditions, consistency=0.7)
print(fst)
@

The above commands construct a fuzzy set truth table, assign it to an
object called fst, and then print it. Next, we simplify the
truth table through Boolean minimization.

<<>>=
fsans <- reduce(fst)
print(fsans)
@

The print method only shows minimal information, but the summary
method shows futher information on the goodness of fit.
<<>>=
summary(fsans)
@

There is an update method for QCA object, so you can use the following
command to get a result including remainders in the minimization process.
<<>>=
update(fsans, remainders="include")
@

In fsQCA, it is always a good idea to generate a new variable indicating
the fuzzy set membership in the negation set using fsnot. Using this new fuzzy
set score to construct a new fuzzy set truth table and minimize it.

<<>>=
Lipset_fs$Not.Survived <- fsnot(Lipset_fs$Survived.FZ)
fst2 <- fs_truthTable(Lipset_fs,"Not.Survived", conditions, consistency=0.7)
print(fst2)
fsans2 <- reduce(fst2)
summary(fsans2)
